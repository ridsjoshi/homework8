        The API I selected is a REST API that serves uniformly and well formatted jokes.
        I applied filters to the url in order to get jokes that are either specific to
        programming or are miscellaneous. In addition, I added filters in order to block
        any inappropriate content such as racist jokes etc.
    </p>
    <p id = "websiteUsed">
        The website that I used was rapidapi.com
    </p>
    <p id = "options">
        For the API request, I used the GET option in order to get the data from the API.
        I also added the API Key and source in order to access the data in the API.
    </p>
    <p id = "APIApplications">
        This API can be used if someone is trying to get a range of jokes and filter
        through them based off personal preferences.
        Another application of this API is if someone is creating a website for
        children and wants an entertaining source but wants child-friendly humor.
        This can be achieved by using safe mode in the API call.
